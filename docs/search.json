    "text": "The pandas groupby function is one of the most powerful tools for summarizing and aggregating data in Python. It allows you to split your data into groups based on one or more keys, apply aggregation or transformation functions, and combine the results into a new DataFrame.\n\n\nThe following diagram shows the basic concept of splitting, applying functions, and combining results in groupby:\n\n\n\nExample of Pandas groupby output\n\n\n\n\n\nSplitting Data into Meaningful Groups\n\ngroupby allows you to split your dataset based on one or more columns (keys).\n\nExample: You can group sales data by store or by employee to analyze each subgroup separately.\n\n\nAggregation Made Easy\n\nOnce you’ve grouped data, you can apply functions like sum(), mean(), count(), min(), max(), etc., to quickly get summaries.\n\nExample: Calculate the total sales per store or the average sales per employee without manually filtering the data.\n\n\nData Transformation\n\nBeyond aggregation, groupby lets you transform data within each group while keeping the same structure.\n\nExample: Normalize sales by dividing each employee’s sales by their store’s total sales.\n\n\nFlexibility with Complex Operations\n\nYou can use custom functions, multiple aggregations, or even combine groupby with apply() to perform complex operations on groups.\n\nExample: Find the top 2 salespeople per store or calculate the weighted average for each group.\n\n\nEfficiency and Scalability\n\ngroupby is optimized for large datasets. Instead of looping through rows manually, it handles grouping operations internally, which is much faster and cleaner.\n\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:\n\nCreate groups in a DataFrame\nApply aggregation and transformation functions\nFilter and rank groups\nSummarize multiple statistics at once\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll start by creating a simple DataFrame with sales data for a small store:\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = {\n    'Store': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    'Employee': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve', 'Frank', 'Grace'],\n    'Sales': [250, 200, 150, 300, 400, 350, 200],\n    'Hours_Worked': [8, 7, 8, 6, 9, 8, 7]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\ndf\nThis DataFrame contains:\n\nStore: store identifier\nEmployee: employee name\nSales: total sales per employee\nHours_Worked: hours worked by each employee\n\n\n\n\nYou could group the data by the Store column and calculate the total sales per store:\nstore_sales = df.groupby('Store')['Sales'].sum()\nstore_sales\n\ndf.groupby(‘Store’) splits the DataFrame into groups based on the Store column.\n[‘Sales’] selects the column to aggregate.\n.sum() computes the sum of sales for each group.\n\nYou could also group the data by the Store column and calculate the total hours worked per store:\nstore_hours = df.groupby('Store')['Hours_Worked'].sum()\nstore_hours\n\ndf.groupby(‘Store’) splits the DataFrame into groups based on the Store column.\n[‘Hours_Worked’] selects the column we want to aggregate.\n.sum() computes the total hours worked for each store.\n\n\n\n\nYou can compute multiple statistics at once using .agg():\nstore_summary = df.groupby('Store').agg(\n    total_sales=('Sales', 'sum'),\n    average_sales=('Sales', 'mean'),\n    total_hours=('Hours_Worked', 'sum')\n)\nstore_summary\n\nYou can pass a dictionary of {new_column_name: (column_to_aggregate, function)} to .agg().\nSupports multiple aggregation functions at once.\n\n\n\n\nGrouping by multiple keys is also straightforward. Suppose we want average sales by store and employee:\nemployee_summary = df.groupby(['Store', 'Employee'])['Sales'].mean()\nemployee_summary\nEach combination of Store and Employee is treated as a separate group.\n\n\n\nYou can filter groups using .filter(). For example, only keep stores with total sales greater than 500:\nhigh_sales_stores = df.groupby('Store').filter(lambda x: x['Sales'].sum() &gt; 500)\nhigh_sales_stores\n\n\n\n.transform() allows you to perform operations that return an array of the same length as the original DataFrame. For example, calculate each employee’s sales as a percentage of their store’s total sales:\ndf['Sales_Percent'] = df.groupby('Store')['Sales'].transform(lambda x: x / x.sum() * 100)\ndf\nUseful for normalization and creating new columns based on group-level calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n.sum()\nsum values within a group\n\n\n.mean()\naverage values within each group\n\n\n.agg()\nmultiple aggregations at once\n\n\n.filter()\nkeep groups that satisfy a condition\n\n\n.transform()\ntransform values while keeping shape\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEither copy this tutorial code and run it on your own machine or experiment with groupby on your own datasets. Try combining multiple columns, applying different aggregation functions, and transforming groups to calculate percentages or rankings. Understanding groupby deeply will make your data analysis faster, cleaner, and more efficient."
