    "text": "The pandas groupby function is one of the most powerful tools for summarizing and aggregating data in Python. It allows you to split your data into groups based on one or more keys, apply aggregation or transformation functions, and combine the results into a new DataFrame.\nThis tutorial will guide you through creating groups, applying common aggregations, and performing advanced transformations — all without needing to load an external dataset.\n\n\nWe’ll start by creating a simple DataFrame with sales data for a small store:\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = {\n    'Store': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    'Employee': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve', 'Frank', 'Grace'],\n    'Sales': [250, 200, 150, 300, 400, 350, 200],\n    'Hours_Worked': [8, 7, 8, 6, 9, 8, 7]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\ndf\n\n\n\nYou could group the data by the Store column and calculate the total sales per store:\nstore_sales = df.groupby('Store')['Sales'].sum()\nstore_sales\n\ndf.groupby(‘Store’) splits the DataFrame into groups based on the Store column.\n[‘Sales’] selects the column to aggregate.\n.sum() computes the sum of sales for each group.\n\nYou could also group the data by the Store column and calculate the total hours worked per store:\nstore_hours = df.groupby('Store')['Hours_Worked'].sum()\nstore_hours\n\ndf.groupby(‘Store’) splits the DataFrame into groups based on the Store column.\n[‘Hours_Worked’] selects the column we want to aggregate.\n.sum() computes the total hours worked for each store.\n\n\n\n\nYou can compute multiple statistics at once using .agg():\nstore_summary = df.groupby('Store').agg(\n    total_sales=('Sales', 'sum'),\n    average_sales=('Sales', 'mean'),\n    total_hours=('Hours_Worked', 'sum')\n)\nstore_summary\n\nYou can pass a dictionary of {new_column_name: (column_to_aggregate, function)} to .agg().\nSupports multiple aggregation functions at once.\n\n\n\n\nGrouping by multiple keys is also straightforward. Suppose we want average sales by store and employee:\nemployee_summary = df.groupby(['Store', 'Employee'])['Sales'].mean()\nemployee_summary\nEach combination of Store and Employee is treated as a separate group.\n\n\n\nYou can filter groups using .filter(). For example, only keep stores with total sales greater than 500:\nhigh_sales_stores = df.groupby('Store').filter(lambda x: x['Sales'].sum() &gt; 500)\nhigh_sales_stores\n\n\n\n.transform() allows you to perform operations that return an array of the same length as the original DataFrame. For example, calculate each employee’s sales as a percentage of their store’s total sales:\ndf['Sales_Percent'] = df.groupby('Store')['Sales'].transform(lambda x: x / x.sum() * 100)\ndf\nUseful for normalization and creating new columns based on group-level calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n.sum()\nsum values within a group\n\n\n.mean()\naverage values within each group\n\n\n.agg()\nmultiple aggregations at once\n\n\n.filter()\nkeep groups that satisfy a condition\n\n\n.transform()\ntransform values while keeping shape\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment with groupby on your own datasets. Try combining multiple columns, applying different aggregation functions, and transforming groups to calculate percentages or rankings. Understanding groupby deeply will make your data analysis faster, cleaner, and more efficient."
